# Getting Started

## Step 1: Add Bungie Application variables to .env file

At the early stages of development I am not putting my own Application ID to this repo to prevent misuse.
You can create a Bungie Application for free here: [https://www.bungie.net/en/Application](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application)
Follow the example in `.envtemplate`

## Step 2: Run React Native scripts

```
npm start
npm run android
```

No iOS support as of now, it may work or not, I have no way to test it personally.
